Frequently Asked Questions

How is this different from just using ChatGPT?
ChatGPT makes up numbers. It sounds confident, but try putting those figures in a pitch deck — they fall apart under scrutiny. We run three AI models against each other to catch errors, pull from real databases, and then a human checks every number before it goes out. You get citations, not vibes.

What sources do you use?
Public filings, industry databases (Statista, Gartner, etc.), patent records, job postings, app store data, social signals, verified reviews, and more. Every source is cited in the report.

How fast can I get a report?
Standard delivery is 5 business days. Growth plan clients get priority 3-day turnaround. Need it faster? Talk to us.

Can I request any topic?
Pretty much anything in tech and business. SaaS, fintech, healthtech, e-commerce, dev tools, consumer apps. Send us the brief and we'll tell you within 24 hours if we can do it and what it'll cover.

What if I'm not satisfied?
Every plan comes with revision rounds. If the report misses the mark, we fix it — no extra charge. We're building a business on repeat clients, so burning you on the first report would be stupid.
