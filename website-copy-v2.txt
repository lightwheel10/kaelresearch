ChatGPT vs. Kael Research

DIY with ChatGPT: "The developer tools market is estimated to be worth $45 billion..." No source cited. Number may be hallucinated. No segment breakdown. Generic, surface-level. Time spent: ~6 hours of prompting and verifying.

Kael Research: "The developer tools market reached $48.7B in 2025 (Gartner, Feb 2026), growing at 14.2% CAGR, with infrastructure..." Every claim sourced. Triple-checked by AI, then verified by a human. Full segment breakdown with data tables. Specific next steps you can actually act on. Delivered in 3 business days as a polished PDF.

How It Works

Brief Us. Tell us what decision you're trying to make. We scope it in 24 hours.

We Go Deep. Three AI models cross-check thousands of sources against each other. Then a human analyst goes through every number and claim.

You Decide. You get a PDF with sourced data, clear analysis, and specific recommendations. Put it in front of investors as-is.

What You Actually Get. Not a data dump. Every report tells a clear story — what's happening, why it matters, and what you should do about it.

47 pages of analysis. 12 data tables. 86 sources cited. 3 days delivery.

How is this different from just using ChatGPT? ChatGPT makes up numbers. It sounds confident, but try putting those figures in a pitch deck — they fall apart under scrutiny. We run three AI models against each other to catch errors, pull from real databases, and then a human checks every number before it goes out. You get citations, not vibes.

What sources do you use? Public filings, industry databases (Statista, Gartner, etc.), patent records, job postings, app store data, social signals, verified reviews, and more. Every source is cited in the report.

How fast can I get a report? Standard delivery is 5 business days. Growth plan clients get priority 3-day turnaround. Need it faster? Talk to us.

Can I request any topic? Pretty much anything in tech and business. SaaS, fintech, healthtech, e-commerce, dev tools, consumer apps. Send us the brief and we'll tell you within 24 hours if we can do it and what it'll cover.

What if I'm not satisfied? Every plan comes with revision rounds. If the report misses the mark, we fix it — no extra charge. We're building a business on repeat clients, so burning you on the first report would be stupid.
