Nearly every developer you know probably uses an AI coding assistant. DX's latest research — [121,000 developers, 450+ companies](https://getdx.com/research/measuring-ai-code-assistants-and-agents/) — puts the monthly usage number at 92.6%. Sounds like a settled question. It isn't. A solo dev auto-completing functions in Cursor and an enterprise pushing Codex through six months of compliance review are living in different worlds. The story worth telling is in that gap.

## The numbers everyone quotes (and what they miss)

Three data points, three years:

| Survey | Year | Sample | "Using AI tools now" | "Using or plan to" |
|--------|------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai) | 2024 | 65,000+ devs | 62% | 76% |
| [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/12/developer-survey-sentiment-ai-ml/) | 2023 | 90,000+ devs | 44% | 70% |
| [DX / Laura Tacho research](https://shiftmag.dev/this-cto-says-93-of-developers-use-ai-but-productivity-is-still-10-8013/) | Q4 2025–Q1 2026 | 121,000 devs | 92.6% (monthly) | ~97% |

44% to 92.6% in under three years. Nobody disputes the trend anymore. But these surveys flatten a variable that matters a lot: company size.

## Small teams move fast, big teams move carefully

Under 50 engineers? AI coding tools show up overnight. No procurement. No security review. A founder enables Copilot and the team has it by lunch.

Big companies are different. [DX found](https://getdx.com/research/measuring-ai-code-assistants-and-agents/) that even the best-performing large organizations cap out around 60% *active* usage — weekly, habitual use, not "opened it once in January." That 60% ceiling versus 92.6% monthly tells you everything about the enterprise adoption gap.

Rough pattern:

| Company size | Typical adoption rate | Active weekly usage | Primary blocker |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------| 
| 1–50 engineers | >90% | ~75% | Individual preference |
| 51–500 engineers | ~80% | ~55% | Security review, budget |
| 500–5,000 engineers | ~70% | ~45% | Compliance, SSO/audit requirements |
| 5,000+ engineers | ~65% | ~35% | Procurement, data residency, IP concerns |

*Synthesized from [DX benchmarks](https://getdx.com/research/measuring-ai-code-assistants-and-agents/) (4M+ samples, hundreds of orgs), [Stack Overflow 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai), and [Pragmatic Summit keynote](https://shiftmag.dev/this-cto-says-93-of-developers-use-ai-but-productivity-is-still-10-8013/).*

Big companies adopting slower — fine, obvious. The weird part is how many licenses go unused. A 500-person eng org buys Copilot for everyone. 45% open it in a given week. The rest? Expensive shelfware.

## The productivity plateau is real — and it hits different by size

[Laura Tacho's DX research](https://shiftmag.dev/this-cto-says-93-of-developers-use-ai-but-productivity-is-still-10-8013/) found that productivity gains from AI coding tools have flatlined at about 10%. Developers save 3.6–4 hours a week — same number as Q2 2025. The needle stopped moving.

Except that's an average. Averages lie.

Small orgs tend to get more out of these tools. Simpler codebases. Faster CI. Developers who do everything. A full-stack dev at a 20-person startup scaffolds an API endpoint with Copilot and saves an hour — visible immediately.

At a 5,000-person company, the same tool collides with slow CI pipelines, three rounds of code review, and legacy code that AI can't parse. [Stack Overflow's 2024 survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai) found 45% of professional developers rate AI tools as "bad or very bad at handling complex tasks." Complex tasks live at big companies.

DX's numbers get wilder. Well-run orgs? 50% fewer customer-facing incidents with AI. Messy orgs? Incidents *doubled*. Same tools, opposite outcomes. [Tacho's take](https://shiftmag.dev/this-cto-says-93-of-developers-use-ai-but-productivity-is-still-10-8013/): "AI tends to highlight existing flaws rather than fix them." Messy orgs tend to be bigger ones. Not a rule. But a pattern.

## AI-authored code is climbing fast

One metric that cuts through the adoption noise: the share of production code written by AI. [DX tracked 4.2 million developers](https://shiftmag.dev/this-cto-says-93-of-developers-use-ai-but-productivity-is-still-10-8013/) between November 2025 and February 2026:

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| AI-authored code in production | 26.9% | Up from 22% previous quarter |
| AI-authored code (daily users) | ~33% | Approaching one-third |
| Onboarding time (time to 10th PR) | Cut in half | Steady decline since Q1 2024 |

That onboarding cut matters most for big companies. New hires at large orgs historically take months to ship anything in a sprawling codebase. Cut that ramp in half and the ROI math changes completely. It stops being about writing code faster. It becomes about making people useful sooner.

## Which tools win at which scale

Tool choice maps pretty cleanly to org size:

| Segment | Dominant tools | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Solo / small team | [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), Claude Code, Windsurf | Best DX, no procurement needed |
| Mid-market (50–500) | GitHub Copilot, Cursor Business | Balance of features and admin controls |
| Enterprise (500+) | GitHub Copilot Enterprise, [Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/) | SSO, audit logs, IP indemnification |

[Codex](https://shiftmag.dev/this-cto-says-93-of-developers-use-ai-but-productivity-is-still-10-8013/) deserves a special mention. The desktop app launched February 2 and hit one million downloads within weeks, growing 60% week-over-week. Inside OpenAI, 95% of developers use it and submit roughly 60% more pull requests per week. Cisco deployed it to 18,000 engineers for migrations and code reviews, cutting review time in half.

Enterprise adoption of Codex is early though. Most big companies haven't finished security vetting. Copilot Enterprise stays the default at scale because GitHub already lives in their stack.

Mid-market is where Cursor and similar AI-native editors are winning. Deep model integration, reasonable admin controls on the business tier, none of the enterprise procurement overhead. Good enough for a 200-person eng org.

## The experience gap nobody talks about

[Stack Overflow's 2023 data](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/12/developer-survey-sentiment-ai-ml/) had a pattern that jumped out:

| Experience | Using AI tools | Don't plan to |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Less than 1 year | 55.1% | 21.4% |
| 1–5 years | 51.3% | 24.5% |
| 6–10 years | 42.3% | 30.2% |
| 11–15 years | 39.5% | 32.5% |
| 16–20 years | 35.9% | 36.0% |
| 21+ years | 30.2% | 42.2% |

This connects directly to company size. Older, larger companies employ more senior engineers. A shop where average tenure is 12 years will see lower organic adoption than a startup where the median engineer has three years under their belt. Senior engineers aren't Luddites. They're working on problems where current AI tools genuinely can't help much yet.

## Geography makes it messier

Where your developers sit changes things too. From [the same Stack Overflow data](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/12/developer-survey-sentiment-ai-ml/):

| Country | Using or plan to use |
|---------|---------------------|
| 🇮🇳 India | 83.6% |
| 🇧🇷 Brazil | 78.0% |
| 🇺🇸 United States | 63.9% |
| 🇩🇪 Germany | 63.9% |
| 🇬🇧 United Kingdom | 61.3% |
| 🇫🇷 France | 61.4% |

India and Brazil lead. Younger developer populations, faster-growing tech sectors. [GitHub's Octoverse report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/) projects India will have the most developers on GitHub by 2028 — generative AI contributions on the platform surged 59% in 2024.

For multinationals, this means a patchwork. Your Bangalore team is all-in on Copilot. Your Munich office wants to see more evidence first. That's not a tech problem. It's a cultural one.

## So what do you actually do

**Small team, under 50 engineers.** Pick something and commit to it. Cursor or Claude Code for the best solo experience. Copilot if everyone uses VS Code. Don't agonize over the choice — daily habit matters more than which tool.

**Mid-market, 50–500.** Track active usage, not seat count. [DX recommends](https://getdx.com/research/measuring-ai-code-assistants-and-agents/) measuring weekly active users and time saved per developer. Booking.com did this across 3,500 engineers — [16% throughput increase](https://getdx.com/customers/booking-drives-ai-adoption-with-dx/).

**Enterprise, 500+.** The tool is almost irrelevant. What matters: fast CI, clear docs, well-defined service boundaries. [DX identifies these](https://getdx.com/research/measuring-ai-code-assistants-and-agents/) as the real predictors of whether AI tools deliver value. Fix developer experience first. Add AI second. Otherwise you're just automating dysfunction.

The winners aren't the companies that adopted first. They're the ones that measured what happened after and changed course when the data told them to. [Laura Tacho's blunt summary](https://shiftmag.dev/this-cto-says-93-of-developers-use-ai-but-productivity-is-still-10-8013/): "This is really a management problem."
