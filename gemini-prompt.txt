You are a world-class frontend developer. Generate a COMPLETE Next.js page.tsx file for a premium AI research intelligence service called 'Kael Research' (kaelresearch.com).

This is a service that sells market research reports, competitor intelligence, and strategic analysis to startups, SaaS founders, and small VCs. It's powered by 3 SOTA AI models running 24/7 but verified by humans.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Ultra-premium, modern dark theme (slate-950/900 base)
- Emerald/cyan gradient accents
- Smooth scroll animations using CSS (no framer-motion)
- Glass morphism effects on cards
- Subtle grid/dot background pattern
- Professional typography with good hierarchy
- Mobile responsive

OUTPUT THE COMPLETE FILE with these sections:

1. HERO: Bold headline 'Research That Gives You an Unfair Advantage', subtext about AI-powered intelligence delivered in days not weeks. Two CTAs: 'Get a Free Sample' (primary emerald button) and 'See Our Work' (secondary/ghost button). Add floating gradient orbs in the background for visual interest.

2. SOCIAL PROOF BAR: 'Trusted by founders at YC, Techstars, and 50+ startups' with a subtle divider line

3. SERVICES (3 cards with glass morphism effect - backdrop-blur, semi-transparent bg, border): 
   - Market Deep Dives (TAM/SAM, customer segments, pricing benchmarks, entry strategies)
   - Competitor Intelligence (feature matrices, pricing tracking, positioning analysis, strategic moves)
   - Strategic Reports (due diligence, investment memos, go-to-market strategies, board-ready decks)

4. HOW IT WORKS: 3 steps with a horizontal connecting line between them. Step 1: You Brief Us (tell us what decisions you need to make). Step 2: AI + Human Research (3 SOTA models analyze thousands of sources, human analysts verify every claim). Step 3: Actionable Intelligence (polished PDF report with executive summary, data tables, strategic recommendations)

5. SAMPLE DELIVERABLE PREVIEW: Show a mockup/preview of what a report looks like - a dark card styled like a document with report title 'SaaS Market Analysis: Developer Tools 2026', table of contents items listed, showing '47 pages', '12 data tables', '3-day turnaround'

6. PRICING: 3 tiers in cards. 
   - Starter ($149/report - single topic deep-dive, 15-25 pages, 5-day delivery, 1 revision round)
   - Growth ($499/mo - 2 reports/month, weekly competitor alerts, priority 3-day turnaround, unlimited revisions, Slack/email delivery) - highlighted as 'Most Popular' with emerald border glow
   - Enterprise ($299/report - comprehensive 30-50 page analysis, investment-grade quality, 2 revision rounds, executive summary + appendix)

7. FAQ: 5 expandable questions using React useState (not HTML details/summary). Questions:
   - 'How is this different from just using ChatGPT?'
   - 'What sources do you use?'
   - 'How do you ensure accuracy?'
   - 'Can I request a custom topic?'
   - 'What format are reports delivered in?'

8. FINAL CTA SECTION: 'Stop Googling. Start Knowing.' with subtext and a mailto link button for free sample report
