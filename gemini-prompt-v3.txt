You are a world-class conversion-focused frontend developer and copywriter. Generate a COMPLETE Next.js page.tsx file for 'Kael Research' (kaelresearch.com) — an AI-powered research intelligence service.

CRITICAL CONTEXT: This landing page must overcome the #1 objection: "Why would I pay for this when I can use ChatGPT myself?" The entire page should be structured to answer that objection without ever sounding defensive.

DESIGN: Ultra-premium dark theme (slate-950/900), emerald/cyan accents, glassmorphism cards, subtle grid background, gradient orbs, Inter font, fully responsive.

SECTIONS IN ORDER:

1. NAV: Sticky with backdrop blur. Logo "KAEL" white + "RESEARCH" emerald. Links: How It Works, Pricing, FAQ. CTA button: "Get a Free Sample".

2. HERO: 
- Small badge with animated pulse dot: "Now accepting Q2 2026 clients"
- Headline: "You Could Google It. Or You Could Know It."
- Subtext: "Your competitors are making decisions with gut feelings and ChatGPT hallucinations. Get research that's sourced, verified, and ready for your board meeting — in 3 days."
- Two CTAs: "Get a Free Sample Report" (primary emerald) and "See Example Output" (ghost button linking to #comparison)

3. THE PROBLEM (pain points section):
- Heading: "Sound Familiar?"
- 3 cards with relatable pain scenarios:
  Card 1: "Investor meeting in 5 days" — "You need TAM numbers, competitor analysis, and a market map. You've been Googling for 3 hours and have 47 tabs open."
  Card 2: "Competitor just raised $20M" — "What are they building? Who are they hiring? Where are they expanding? Your team is guessing."
  Card 3: "Board wants a GTM strategy" — "For a new market you've never operated in. Due Thursday. You're one person."
- Below cards: "You could spend 20 hours stitching together half-sourced data. Or you could spend $149 and have it Tuesday."

4. COMPARISON SECTION (id="comparison") - THIS IS THE KEY SECTION:
- Heading: "ChatGPT vs. Kael Research"
- Side-by-side visual comparison in a styled card:
  Left column (labeled "DIY with ChatGPT", muted/red tint):
    - "The developer tools market is estimated to be worth $45 billion" 
    - Red X icon, "No source cited"
    - Red X icon, "Number may be hallucinated"  
    - Red X icon, "No segment breakdown"
    - Red X icon, "Generic, surface-level"
    - "Time spent: ~6 hours of prompting and verifying"
  Right column (labeled "Kael Research", emerald tint):
    - "The developer tools market reached $48.7B in 2025 (Gartner, Feb 2026), growing at 14.2% CAGR, with infrastructure tooling ($18.3B) as the largest segment..."
    - Green check, "Every claim sourced"

    - Green check, "Actionable strategic recommendations"

- Title: "SaaS Market Analysis: Developer Tools 2026"
- Table of contents: Executive Summary (p3), Market Sizing TAM/SAM (p8), Competitor Matrix (p15), Pricing Analysis (p24), Strategic Recommendations (p42)
- Stats next to it: 47 pages, 12 data tables, 86 sources cited, 3-day delivery

8. FAQ (useState accordion, 5 items):
- "How is this different from just using ChatGPT?" → "ChatGPT is a generalist that hallucinates numbers. We use 3 specialized models cross-referenced against each other, connected to real data sources, and every claim is verified by a human analyst before delivery. You get sourced facts, not plausible fiction."
- "What sources do you use?" → "Public filings, industry databases (Statista, Gartner, etc.), patent records, job postings, app store data, social signals, verified reviews, and more. Every source is cited in the report."
- "How fast can I get a report?" → "Standard delivery is 5 business days. Growth plan clients get priority 3-day turnaround. Need it faster? Talk to us."
- "Can I request any topic?" → "If it can be researched, we can cover it. SaaS, fintech, healthtech, e-commerce, developer tools, consumer apps — you name it. We scope feasibility within 24 hours of your brief."
- "What if I'm not satisfied?" → "Every plan includes revision rounds. If the report doesn't meet the brief, we revise it at no extra cost. We'd rather over-deliver than lose your trust."

9. FINAL CTA:
- "Stop Googling. Start Knowing."
