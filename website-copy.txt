Frequently Asked Questions

How is this different from just using ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is a generalist that hallucinates numbers. We use 3 specialized models cross-referenced against each other, connected to real data sources, and every claim is verified by a human analyst before delivery. You get sourced facts, not plausible fiction.

What sources do you use?
Public filings, industry databases (Statista, Gartner, etc.), patent records, job postings, app store data, social signals, verified reviews, and more. Every source is cited in the report.

How fast can I get a report?
Standard delivery is 5 business days. Growth plan clients get priority 3-day turnaround. Need it faster? Talk to us.

Can I request any topic?
If it can be researched, we can cover it. SaaS, fintech, healthtech, e-commerce, developer tools, consumer apps — you name it. We scope feasibility within 24 hours of your brief.

What if I'm not satisfied?
Every plan includes revision rounds. If the report doesn't meet the brief, we revise it at no extra cost. We'd rather over-deliver than lose your trust.
