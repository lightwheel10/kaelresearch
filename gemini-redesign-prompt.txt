You are redesigning a premium market research report page for kaelresearch.com. This is our sample report that sells our service — it needs to look like something McKinsey or Goldman Sachs would produce, but more modern and readable.

TECH STACK:
- Next.js 16 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- Recharts for interactive charts (already installed)
- 'use client' directive required at top
- File: src/app/sample/page.tsx

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
1. Dark theme: bg-slate-950 as base, amber-500/amber-400 as accent color
2. Must match main site nav: fixed top nav with "KAEL" (white) "RESEARCH" (amber-400), backdrop-blur
3. Interactive charts using Recharts (BarChart, PieChart, LineChart, RadarChart, AreaChart — all imported from 'recharts')
4. Premium feel: generous whitespace, clear hierarchy, professional typography
5. NO emoji in the design (use SVG icons or colored indicators instead)
6. NO hover glow effects, NO emerald/cyan gradients
7. Mobile responsive
8. Email gate: if localStorage 'kael_email' doesn't exist, show email capture form instead of report

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Email gate form posts to /api/subscribe with JSON { email }
- On success, set localStorage 'kael_email' and show report
- Nav has "Download PDF" button linking to /api/pdf
- Nav has "Order a Report" button linking to /#pricing
- Footer matches main site: "KAEL RESEARCH" branding, copyright 2026, contact@kaelresearch.com link

Section 7: Strategic Recommendations (5 items)
1. Don't build another general-purpose assistant — target a niche
2. Bet on agents, not autocomplete — autocomplete is commoditized
3. Enterprise is revenue, developers are distribution — need both tiers
4. Solve trust first — SOC 2 Type II, transparent data handling
5. Build for model-agnostic future — automatic model routing

Section 8: Methodology
- Primary + secondary research, Gartner/IDC/Forrester, Stack Overflow/JetBrains surveys
- 34 structured interviews Oct 2025 - Jan 2026
- Bottom-up market sizing, hands-on product testing
- No sponsorship from covered companies

IMPORTANT TYPESCRIPT NOTES:
- Recharts Tooltip formatter prop: do NOT type the parameter explicitly (use (v) => not (v: number) =>)
- Use 'as const' for textAlign values or cast them
- All chart components must be wrapped in {mounted && (...)} where mounted is a useEffect state
- Import useRouter from 'next/navigation'

OUTPUT: Complete page.tsx file. Output raw code only, no markdown fences, no explanation. The file must start with 'use client'; and be a complete working React component.
